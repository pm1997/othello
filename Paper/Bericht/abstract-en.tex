\mxZitat{\ot} is a variant of the game \mxZitat{Reversi}. As a classical game of thought it is played by two players against each other. By that, the game is well suited to be converted into a computer vs. human player game.
\\Therefore the main goal of this paper is to develop computer controlled agents available to act as opponents to human players.
\\In doing so multiple agents were developed based on the strategies of \abp and the \mc\ Algorithms. If required by the strategy heuristics were used to evaluate individual game states.
\\Besides other heuristics one is based on the average probability of winning a game as a result to a specific decision during the game. The implementation of this approach relies upon symmetric properties of the playing field.
\\The agents described are implemented in the programming language \mxZitat{Python}
\\For evaluation, the results of the agents againts an agent performing random moves are considered as well as the results of the agents playing against each other. Using the parameters set for the evaluation, the agent based on the \mc\ algorithm is able to win the comparison.
\\The heuristic based on the average probability of winning a game as a result to a specific decision during the game is outperformed by other heuristics.
